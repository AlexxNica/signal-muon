# Signal Muon

[Signal Desktop](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Desktop) built on top
of [Muon](https://github.com/Brave/muon).

*THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY. DO NOT USE IT.*

## Running

You must have node and npm installed.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/diracdeltas/signal-muon.git
cd signal-muon
npm install
npm start
```

## Caveats

You can only message accounts that are registered on the Signal **staging**
server, so you will probably be very lonely unless you want to talk to other
Signal contributors.

That means you can talk to me! My test number is (oldest
telephone area code in San Francisco) + (decimal char code of capital Epsilon) + (the 513th prime).
